                <h2 class="fw-bolder">London</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >As the capital of England and the country’s largest, London was always going to be on this list. It is one of the greatest arts and cultural hubs in both Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">London is easily the most popular and famous to visit in England, and for many good reasons. London is full of attractions, including historical sites, landmarks, art galleries, theatres, and museums. Your days visiting London will be varied and action-packed. For example, you may spend a morning at the Natural History Museum, an afternoon grabbing lunch and shopping at the market in Camden Borough, and an evening watching a West End show.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">If you are a first-time visitor to the UK, prioritize a visit to London. Not only does the city give you a broad impression of England, but London is also very accessible.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">You’ll be bowled over by the number of things to do and see; just do some research and choose where to stay carefully beforehand to maximize your time when you arrive. If you need some extra guidance, you can read our 3-day itinerary for more information.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Edinburgh</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Edinburgh is an amazing city to visit. As the Scottish capital, it attracts millions of tourists and, honestly, you should join the crowd.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Edinburgh is famed for its Old Town, which has those dreamy cobbled streets lined with independent shops, cafes, and restaurants. Some of the buildings in the Old Town are 500 years old, and the architecture gives the neighborhood a time capsule effect – especially with Edinburgh Castle and the sound of bagpipes in the background.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Edinburgh Castle is easily one of the best things to do, although you should also visit the National Museum, climb the Scott Monument, and walk the Royal Mile. Edinburgh excellently encapsulates Scottish culture, history, and identity.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">As a first-time visitor to Scotland, we’d highly recommend visiting Edinburgh.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Belfast</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >The Northern Irish capital is well-deserving of a place on our list; Belfast has a lot going for it.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Belfast is easily added to a trip to England. You can catch a ferry from Liverpool or a domestic flight from any UK airport – sometimes costing less than $15 when booked in advance.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Belfast has a vibrant feel, with plenty of new developments like Castle Court Shopping Center. However, there is also a lot of history. You can learn about The Troubles by touring Belfast’s political murals, visiting the Titanic Belfast Museum, touring Crumlin Road Gaol, or walking up to Stormont – the home of the NI government.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">From the city, there are hundreds of things to do, including visiting The Giant’s Causeway and the Mourne Mountains. Belfast is a fantastic base if you want to experience Northern Ireland for the first or millionth time.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Oxford</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Speaking of elite universities, Oxford is Cambridge’s rival city. Oxford is home to Oxford University, which was established in the 12th century and is renowned across the world.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Like Cambridge, Oxford is a city where you go to experience southern Englishness. The city center is full of gothic architecture, and the buildings are typically made from pale cream clipsham stone. Oxford has a definite aesthetic, and it is easy to imagine yourself stepping back a hundred years.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Oxford also has a beautiful cathedral and is famous for its arts. Literature lovers should prioritize visiting the Bodleian Library, the UK’s second-largest library and containing over 11 million texts.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">York</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >York is a quiet city surrounded mostly by country towns and villages. It may not be a popular destination for first-time travelers to the UK, but York does provide an idyllic introduction to England.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">York is in the county of North Yorkshire and, despite its city status, has more of a town feel than a metropolitan one. York has incredible architecture, with its walls dating back to the 13th century and its narrowing shopping street, The Shambles, widely hailed as one of the best-preserved medieval streets in Europe.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">York Minster Cathedral is beautiful to visit, while the York Dungeons and Jorvik Viking Center are immersive historical attractions to enjoy. Since York is located near both the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors National Parks, we’d suggest allowing time for a day trip in your itinerary.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">For a laidback trip to Britain, York provides a relaxing experience with world-renowned, stunning medieval architecture.</p>
