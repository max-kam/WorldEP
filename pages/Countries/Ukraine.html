                  <p class="fs-5" >The capital city of Ukraine, Kyiv is most well known for its diverse population, interesting modern architecture, and friendly locals. It also features the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves and Saint Sophia Cathedral, and although visitors can tour the monastery, it is also still in working order.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">There are a range of museums to choose from in Kyiv in order to learn more about the local history or culture, or you can check out the latest theatre listings at one of the smaller theatres like the famous Puppet Theatre.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">This may well be the capital of Ukraine, but it is also an extremely green city featuring not one but two botanical gardens that are perfect for strolling around in the afternoons under the iconic horse chestnut trees that line the roads of Kyiv.</p>

                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Kamianets-Podilskyi</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Kamianets-Podilskyi, a city in the west of Ukraine, has a long history of immigration and each influence is present in the architecture and culture of the city, including Armenian and Polish markets still found today.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">The city is awash with ancient monuments such as its castle, cathedral, and crumbling fortifications and, due to its location on the Smotrych River, there are an abundance of outdoor activities for those wanting to do something a little different.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Among these are balloon trips over the Smotrych Canyon, as well as race car driving. Also located over the Smotrych River is the Stara Fortetsya, an ancient city fortress that invites visitors to marvel at the preserved ruins.</p>

                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Lviv</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >The historic centre of the city of Lviv is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and visitors will be able to understand why due to the wealth of monuments and ancient buildings on show here, many of which date back to the 13th century.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Aside from the historical jewels on offer here, Lviv is famous for being an artistic hub in Ukraine, and there are galleries all over the city as well as the Lviv National Art Gallery that is said to house over 50,000 works including paintings, sculptures, and art installations.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">If you enjoy opera or ballet, then Lviv is also famous for its classically trained performers and opulent performances in regular rotation.</p>

                  <p class="fs-5" >The third largest city in Ukraine, Odesa is a seaport that rest of the shores of the mythical Black Sea. Now an important trade city, visitors gravitate to Odesa for the sandy beaches, clement weather, and sparkling waters, particularly Lanzheron Beach, a perfect place for sun worshippers.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Odesa, also referred to as the ‘Pearl of the Black Sea’, may be a large city but its construction gives it an intimate feel, with labyrinthine lanes to navigate as well as nooks and crannies to explore, ending in secluded squares and delightful houses painted in mellow pastel shades.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">The city’s big claim to fame is the mighty stairway that leads from the centre of town to the beach front, and there are also leafy parks like the City Gardens to enjoy, as well as a bit of culture in the form of the Odesa Opera House and the numerous theatres in the city.</p>

                  <p class="fs-5">The architecture of Chernivtsi is said to be similar to that of Vienna, leading to the name ‘Little Vienna’ to describe parts of the city, and many locals point to the relaxed nature of the city which has a strong cafe culture, as well as a range of notable bookshops and book stalls that are said to reflect the intellectual and poetic atmosphere found here.</p>
