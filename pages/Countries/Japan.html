                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Tokyo</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >When you think of cities in Japan, it’s safe to say that Tokyo will be in your top three. As the capital, Tokyo is one of the major Japanese cities and attracts millions of tourists a year. It is also the largest city in Japan, with an estimated population of around 14 million people.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Think busy streets, fast-paced entertainment, and flashing neon lights – Tokyo is hectic but exciting. Tokyo is where to visit if you want to be right in the thick of all the action, with plenty of museums to tour, shopping to bag, and fun to be had. The sheer size of the city is exciting in itself.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">So, where do you begin? What are the best things to do in Tokyo? Well, after visiting the city a few times we suggest starting with Tokyo Tower. Tokyo Tower may look familiar, and it should be. The tower was heavily inspired by the Eiffel Tower. In fact, the only difference is that Tokyo Tower is 333 meters tall and red and white.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Osaka</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Osaka is another one of Japan’s large cities. Osaka has a strong character, and the port city has a commercial soul with lots going on at all hours of day and night. There’s always street food to taste, a bar to hop to, and attractions to visit. Osaka is a great place to visit if you love a mixture of partying, relaxing, and sightseeing. The city has lots of personality and a balance of everything – like a compromise with no sacrifice.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">To appreciate the history of Osaka, a trip to Osaka Castle should be on your itinerary. The 16th-century castle is surrounded by cherry trees and a moat, and Osaka Castle is one of the prettiest places to visit in the city. While, if you want a day of light-hearted fun, there’s Universal Studios Japan to explore. The theme park has Hollywood-themed rides, and it’s conveniently located just outside the center of Osaka.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Finally, Osaka is the famous home of one of Japan’s oldest Shinto shrines. Sumiyoshi Taisha is a popular Shinto shrine to visit – on tourism or religious grounds. We recommend visiting to fully experience Japan’s beautiful religious culture.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Kyoto</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Tokyo might be the capital today, but Kyoto was once the country’s capital. In the center of the Kansai region, Kyoto is one of Japan’s most traditional cities. In Kyoto, you’ll find classic dark wood houses and plenty of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. If you are chasing culture and tradition, Kyoto is a great place to explore in Japan.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">To experience the traditional streets lined by wooden houses, head to Gion. You can wander in the early morning for the quietest streets or at night to see the cobbled roads lit by paper lanterns. Visiting the many temples of Kyoto is also a must-do on your trip, especially the Golden Pavilion. You can admire the Golden Pavilion from across its pond, being wowed by the golden tint that gives it its name and popularity.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Looking for picturesque scenes? Head to the bamboo forest of Arashiyama or the red columned walkways of the Fushimi Inari-Taisha Shrine. Kyoto is full of stunning scenery and eye-opening cultural attractions.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Hiroshima</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Hiroshima is a name not many forget. Sadly, the reason behind Hiroshima being one of the most famous cities in Japan is the atomic bombing that occurred in 1945. The US dropped an atomic bomb on the large city, causing over 100,000 casualties. Visitors to the city can now pay their respects to the victims and destruction at many memorable attractions, including the Peace Park.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">There is much to appreciate about Hiroshima in its own right, though. Food lovers should sample the Japanese pancake, nicknamed Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki. There’s also Hiroshima Castle to tour and Shukkei-en scenic garden to stroll. Hiroshima’s culture and history have not been tainted by the tragic atomic bomb, and you’ll love the city’s variety of attractions.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Nagoya</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Nagoya is known for manufacturing and shipping and is the capital of the Aichi Prefecture. Have you heard of Honda? Toyota? Mitsubishi? All of these big automotive brands were developed in Nagoya. Nagoya has an innovative, industrial atmosphere, ideal for those wanting to experience the business side of Japan.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Visitors should tour the Toyota Exhibition Hall to get a better idea of automotive production in Japan. Nagoya Castle is great for a historical introduction to Nagoya. There are also one-off events in Nagoya like the Nagoya Sumo Tournament in July, the Nagoya Matsuri festival in October, and the World Cosplay Summit in July and August.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Nagoya has lots going on, so don’t forget to check the city’s schedule. And, in your downtime, make sure to try some miso katsu – miso katsu is a regional specialty.</p>
