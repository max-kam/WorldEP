                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Rome</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >The most popular city for tourists is without a doubt Rome. It is often considered one of the best cities in Italy for first-time visitors. At its height, this capital city ruled the Roman Empire, and the ancient ruins scattered throughout put that power on display. With famous landmarks like The Colosseum, the Pantheon, The Roman Forum, Vatican City, and the Trevi Fountain, one could visit again and again getting lost in its architecture.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Not only are there many things to see, but the Eternal City is also one of the most beautiful cities in all of Europe blending the ancient with the new. Plus, where else do you find a sovereign nation inside a city? Saint Peter’s Basilica, The Sistine Chapel is located within The Vatican and is one of Rome’s top attractions.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Once you have explored its main attractions, enjoy its vibrant food scene with a Rome Food Tour, sit on the Spanish steps and relish in the lively atmosphere or sip cappuccinos at one of its many cafes. Rome needs at least three days to explore and we have the complete three-day itinerary to help you out.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Venice</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Venice is the city of dreams. You may have heard people say to not go to Venice, but if you spend some time there (not just on a cruise or day trip) you too will fall in love with its Grand Canal and beautiful old town housing Saint Mark’s Square, Doge’s Palace, Rialto Bridge and the Bridge of Sighs. (Ah, sigh).</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Known for its canals, cathedrals, and the odd gondola or two, Venice is a place for romance especially after the crowds disappear. When the cruise ships and day tours leave, you have the streets and alleyways to yourself in the wee hours of the morning or after sunset. We suggest three days in Venice.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Bologna</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Bologna may be overlooked by the bigger cities of Italy, but after spending nearly a month exploring it and the Emilia Romagna region, we feel it should be put at the top of your list. Known as the culinary capital of Italy, there are plenty of things to do in Bologna besides eating. The old city walls that date back to the middle ages can still be seen and the city’s unique porticoes remain intact. Make sure to visit the main square of Piazza Maggiore where you’ll see the Fountain of Neptune.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">We spent nearly a month exploring this city in Northern Italy and it alone is worth visiting in its own right. But there are so many day trips to surrounding villages, you will fall in love with the region of Emilia Romagna. Bologna is also home to the oldest University in the world, churches, and its own leaning tower that gives Pisa a run for its money! Bologna has plenty of attractions and day trips to keep you busy for at least a week. We suggest exploring the Emilia Romagna region for at least a few days.</p>

              <div class="my-4 border-bottom border-2">
                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Florence</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >Florence is the heart of Tuscany with renaissance art including masterpieces by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Visit the Galleria dell’Accademia to marvel at the statue of David and witness The Birth of Venice by Botticelli in the Uffizi Gallery. Walk through the Piazza del Duomo and view the Florence Cathedral.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">The UNESCO historic center of Florence is easily known as one of the most romantic cities in Italy with heart-melting views over the Arno River from Piazzale Michelangelo where you can see a replica of David.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">If you are looking for romance, Florence is the city for you. Walk hand in hand along its cobblestone streets toward Ponte Vecchio, and visit the romantic cafes at Piazza Della Signoria. We think that Florence only needs two days to visit, but Tuscany requires a week.</p>

                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Verona</h2>
                  <p class="fs-5" >As a music theater major in college Verona always intrigued me. The city came up once or twice while studying Shakespeare and even today the city attracts romance lovers to follow in the footsteps of Romeo and Juliet.</p>
                  <p class="fs-5">Crowds flock to the balcony of Juliette’s house for a glimpse of the famous balcony scene leaving love letters on the walls. But Shakespeare isn’t the only reason to visit Verona. The Verona Arena is one of the best-preserved Roman Amphitheatres in the country. There are churches and bridges, basilicas, and the old medieval bridge of Ponte Scaligaro which leads to Castelvecchio.</p>
